# Resolve

This is a tiny little script for helping me to remember the IP addresses
for the boxes on my network.  I often am working at a different box in my
house. And I cannot remember all the IPs.  Also, I'd like for it to tell 
me eventually whether a box is up or down.

# Arguments

There are two arguments:  `'-h' for *help*  and '-a' for *arp*
'-a' will arp the local subnet and show the available hosts.  If a hostname
cannot be resolved a '?' will replace the hostname
