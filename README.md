# Resolve

This is a tiny little script for helping me to remember the IP addresses
for the boxes on my network.  I often am working at a different box in my
house. And I cannot remember all the IPs.  Also, I'd like for it to tell 
me eventually whether a box is up or down.  But first I'd just like to get
the IP properly.  Eventually I'll get it to tell me all the hostnames that are 
up.  But one step at a time!
